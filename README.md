### 初めまして、「曇り」です。
- EN / some JP / some ES
- **he**/they
- I’m interested in webdev, gamedev, productivity and note-taking software, and pretty much anything that *doesn't involve a smartphone*.
- I’m currently working on improving my C# skills with .NET.
- Open to collaboration on: games, productivity applications, websites, and web apps.


がんばってください皆さん！
